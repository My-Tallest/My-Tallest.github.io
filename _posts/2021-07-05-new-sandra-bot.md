As of posting this the new chatbot is partially coded. So far you can only put tiny people into your panties (front and back) as well as change to panties or a diaper. Over the next few days i plan to add more to the bot. due to personality forge's proprietary nature i have to redo everything from the ground up. However in doing so i found rivescript, a more complex but more feature rich chatbot standard. Once i redo the base code it should proove easier than on personality forge to add new content.
